# React + Vite

In this project, I practice what I learned in my previous React/Vite repositories.

It is a Tenzies game, where you have to set all dice with the same number.

I use concepts like useState, useRef, useEffect, and reusability! And also have a very cool confetti effect!

# Setup 

- npm i 
- npm run dev
